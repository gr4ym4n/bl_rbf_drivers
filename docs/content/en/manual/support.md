## Issue Tracker

All software of even moderate complexity contains bugs, and RBF drivers is a comparatively complex addon. If you think you have found a bug I want to hear about it, but first please take some time to check that the problem is caused by the addon and not user error. If you believe the issue is with the addon then file a bug report in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesvsnowden/bl_rbf_drivers/issues) and I'll take a look at it.

## Support Server
