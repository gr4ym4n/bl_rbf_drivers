## The Rest Pose

All RBF drivers need at least one pose to function. By default it's called the *Rest* pose and it's created automatically for you when you add a new RBF driver. You'll find it at the top of the **Poses** list. There's nothing inherently special about this pose and you can treat is just like any other, but it's important to note that its input and output values are set to sensible defaults that in some cases you will want to change.
