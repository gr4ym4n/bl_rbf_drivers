## Introduction

In [Getting Started](/tutorials/getting-started) and [Pose Interpolation](/tutorials/pose-interpolation) we set up a simple RBF driver to interpolate the X location of an *Output* bone based on the X location of an *Input* bone. Although it would've taken a little longer, we could have done the same thing in Blender without using RBF drivers at all. In this tutorial we'll start to see some of the advantages of RBF Drivers as we start adding more *Input* properties, *Output* properties, and poses.

This tutorial follows on directly from [**Pose Interpolation**](/tutorials/pose-interpolation). If you haven't done so already, you'll probably want to go back and complete that first. If you want to skip that tutorial or no longer have the blend file, you can download it [here](/blend/pose_interpolation.blend)
