Once you've downloaded RBF Drivers you should have a file named *rbf_drivers.zip*. Don't unzip the file, instead open Blender and then open the preferences from the edit menu.

Select the **Add-ons** pane from the menu on the left and click the **Install** button. Navigate to the location of the downloaded zip file and click **Install Add-on**.

If it's not already shown, find the *RBF Drivers* add-on in the list of add-ons (it's in the *Rigging* category) and check the box next to it to enable the add-on.

You're now ready to go, but it is strongly recommended to at least go through the [tutorials](/tutorials/getting-started) first to make sure you get the most out of the add-on.

## License Key / Auto Update

Like all Blender addons, RBF Drivers is released under a permissive open source GPL license. However, if you have supported development by purchasing the addon we provide extra [support](/support) and services. You should receive a license key from us that you can copy/paste into the **License Key** field in the addon's preferences to enable the auto-update feature.
